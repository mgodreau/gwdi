# Office Hours

Office hours will be from 5:30-7:30pm two nights a week. There will be no office hours during project weeks.

- Britney Jo will be here on Tuesdays
- Riley will be here on Wednesdays

The format is informal: the instructors are "on duty" to help with homework or anything that you may have questions about in general from class.

You are strongly encouraged to use these times to also work with fellow students on assignments and projects!

We will book a designated room each night and will notify you on that day.
