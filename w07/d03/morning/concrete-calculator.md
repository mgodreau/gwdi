# Concrete Calculator

Create a react app that allows a user to input the size of their space to figure out how many yards of concrete they need.

The formula for calculating concrete yards is: `(length * width * depth) / 27 = totalYards`

## Steps

1. Initialize Concrete Calculator using create-react-app
2. Render a form in /src/App.js
3. Set up event listener to handle the form submission
4. Add concrete formula to adjust `totalYards` needed (Since totalYards will change, it should be handled by state in the app)
