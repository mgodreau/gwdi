### Overview

This week's project will be a deep-dive into the power of front end frameworks, specifically React. You will be building an app that will focus on the client side with a much smaller emphasis on the back end (database is optional). 

You will be working in groups to design and build a React or React Native app that makes AJAX calls to at least 1 (preferably more) API and renders in a single page application. We are keeping the guidelines loose so you can get creative with your project ideas. Keep in mind what makes React so cool when brainstorming ideas - self-contained components, modularity, performance, maintainability, etc. Please make sure the instructor team approves anything before you begin coding. 

You will also be working with UXDI students on this project: 

- Friday 11/11 @ 4pm: Meet with UXDI to show initial wireframes
- Tuesday 11/15 @ 3pm: Wireframe feedback & findings w/ UXDI
- Wednesday 11/16 @ 9am: UXDI provides styleguides
- Friday 11/18 @ 2pm: Final Presentations with UXDI

### Necessary Deliverables

- You must come up with a team name and spirit animal
- A working web app, built by the whole team, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
- A team git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project
- A `readme.md` file with technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, wireframes, hosted working app, etc.

### Tips

* Work together initially to come up with wireframes, user stories, ERD's etc, but adopt a "divide and conquer" type approach afterwards
* Try pair programming through the tougher parts of your application
* Deploy early, don't wait until the day before to attempt doing this
