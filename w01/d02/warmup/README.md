### Overview
Throughout the course, you'll be expected to write at least four blog posts. Tentative blog post due dates are:
- October 6th
- October 20th
- November 9th
- December 1st

### Guidelines
- Blog posts do not have to be long! Quality over length.
- Choose a *specific topic* and dive into it. A blog post on "How to Format Your Command Line Prompt" will likely be more enticing than a generic post on "The Command Line."
- At least **three** of your posts should be technical and include code snippets. (Remember the tip to use backticks to insert lines of code into your text)
- Think of snappy titles!
- Use gifs, screenshots, images, etc.
- Be yourself. Even though you're writing blog posts on technical topics, your posts can _and should_ assume your own voice.
- [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) is a great platform for your blog to live! If you already keep a blog, feel free to use that as an alternative.

### Why blog?

> Keeping a technical blog can be a great way of documenting your growth as a developer.

>This documentation can be particularly useful on a professional level. All software companies want to hire smart, thoughtful, communicative developers who can easily assimilate into a team, and who are ready to both teach and learn. Your technical blog is empirical evidence of all of these qualities.

Learning to code in twelve weeks will be challenging, and you will run into concepts that you don't understand at first. These are the perfect topics for blog posts – if you work through a problem and write about it in detail, you will develop both a greater understanding for the concept at hand AND a reference material that you can refer to later.

There is **so much cool stuff** to explore and blog about. Be hungry for knowledge. Dive in!

This is a great way to network and start sharing ideas and experiences. Share your posts on twitter, linkedin, etc. You never know what connections you will make and who will read your blog. Make yours something you'd want to read yourself.
