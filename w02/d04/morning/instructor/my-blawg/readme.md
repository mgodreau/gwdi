- All elements with class `post`
- The first element with class `post`
- The second element with class `post`
- The HTML content of the first `<a>` element on the page
- Using a CSS pseudo-selector, the third element with class `post`
- Using its HTML attribute, the fourth `<img>` on the page

# Part Two: Getting and Setting

Using these jQuery methods or attributes, follow the instructions below:
